# General Introduction

This scoring system is meant to assess the positive societal impact of
investment funds, especially public equity funds. We hope to add value not through
collecting new data, but by analyzing existing data and determining what
information is truly relevant to assessing a fund’s impact.

This ranking poses the question “is the fund having as much impact as it can?”
For this reason, funds of any size can receive the maximum score.

Scoring rubrics are different for funds that invest in different
geographies. This is because formal engagement (Shareholder resolutions)
is well developed and has strong legal protections in the U.S.
Therefore, funds can create impact through the resolution process in the
U.S. Informal engagement (outside of the proxy process), becomes more
valuable outside of the U.S. There is infrastructure in place for these
investors to participate in significant dialogue and create impact in
non-US developed markets. In developing markets, engagement is more
nascent, and funds create more impact by signaling the importance of ESG
through investment strategies, and supporting a strong ESG policy and
regulatory environment. Real Impact Tracker will watch this space
closely over the next few years and adjust accordingly as more firms
engage in developing markets.

# ESG Investing

By impacting demand for a company, ESG investing can positively impact
the stock price of high-ESG performing companies, and negatively impact
the stock price of low-ESG performing companies, which affects cost of
capital. Additionally, investors can spread the word about ESG to
increase the adoption of ESG strategies. Most importantly, ESG investors
that perform well may attract new dollars to ESG investing due to
institutional herding.\[1\] \[2\] High performing ESG strategies bring
increased credibility and attention to the field. Similarly, poor
performers may deter potential ESG investors. A number of surveys show
that a major factor holding people back from ESG investing is the
perception of underperformance.\[3\] \[4\]

Positive screening has more impact than negative screening under the
assumptions of the efficient markets hypothesis. Because efficient
markets assume no capital constraints, an amoral investor could allocate
limitless capital towards stocks perceived to be undervalued, negating
any price impact of negative screening. Note that under inefficient
markets, there is no apparent relationship between the price impact of a
screen and its direction.

Performance calculations compare a fund’s risk-adjusted returns to its
market benchmark. There are a number of ways to calculate risk-adjusted
performance, each with their own merits and drawbacks, so the specific
implementation is left up to the discretion of the reviewer that applies
the methodology. In line with industry standards, we use a composite
metric that includes a fund’s sharpe ratio and information ratio.

For each trailing time period, funds are awarded 0.1 performance points
for each % of risk-adjusted outperformance (-0.1 for each %
underperformance). Performance points are capped at 1 per time period.
Total performance points is the sum of performance points for each of
the three time periods.

If funds haven’t existed for a full time period, they receive zero
points for that time period. If the fund has no ESG strategy, they
receive 0 performance points, because the fund’s performance says
nothing about the viability of ESG investing.

Score = (9 \* Total Performance Points)

By conducting ESG research, fund managers accrue knowledge and
expertise, which bolsters the ESG investing sector overall. It
highlights the breadth and depth of ESG strategies, and brings
credibility and attention to the field.

The following categories assess the institutional commitment to the ESG
strategy of the fund. More commitment leads to more resources invested
in ESG, leading to better implementation of ESG strategy. A firm-wide
commitment to ESG leads to a stronger position of engagement and
advocacy across all funds, and the possibility of shared ESG knowledge
and research. More commitment means that the ESG fund managers are more
likely to be empowered to communicate the benefits of ESG, and sends a
signal that the firm believes in ESG generally, and doesn’t see it as a
niche strategy, leading to institutional herding effects described
previously.

# Shareholder Advocacy

## Formal

Shareholder resolutions have contributed to significant changes in
corporate policies and practices. Companies often adopt shareholder
resolutions that go to vote, and since 2010, around 40% of shareholder
proposals on ESG issues have been successfully withdrawn.\[5\] Multiple
analyses suggest that withdrawn shareholder resolutions are generally
substantially implemented.\[6\] \[7\]

| **Points (USA)** | **Points (GLB)** | **Points (EM)** | Pro-ESG Shareholder Resolutions Filed (lead or co-file) |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0**            | **0**            | **0**           | No resolutions filed                                    |
| **6**            | **6**            | **3**           | Filer of 1-3 shareholder resolutions                    |
| **12**           | **NA**           | **NA**          | Filer of 4 or more shareholder resolutions              |

A number of factors lead to a higher chance to shareholder resolution
success

  - > Fund managers that are lead filers of resolutions receive extra
    > points because lead filing signals increased commitment and effort
    > put into changing the company.

  - > Filing multiple shareholder resolutions on the same issue leads to
    > higher shareholder support.\[8\] Persistent engagement
    > familiarizes management and shareholders with the resolution
    > issue, and signal that it is an important and lasting
    > consideration.\[9\]

  - > Resolutions that are withdrawn are generally substantially
    > implemented, leading to impact.\[10\] \[11\]

  - > Though there is a small sample size, resolutions that achieve
    > majority support are generally substantially implemented, leading
    > to impact.\[12\]

  - > Shareholder resolutions on new issues can start a conversation
    > both inside and outside the company.\[13\] Resolutions can
    > legitimize and bolster other actors in civil society focused on
    > those issues.\[14\] Since shareholder engagement can lead to
    > reforms at peer firms,\[15\] filing a new shareholder resolution
    > can also have impact by bringing the issue to the attention of
    > peer companies. Thus, fund managers get points for introducing new
    > resolutions that haven’t been filed before.

Proxy voting is a tool for effecting change within a company. Generally,
the higher percentage of a vote a resolution receives, the greater the
likelihood that it will be taken seriously by management. Therefore we
assign negative points to poor proxy voting records.

We look at % votes in favor of ESG shareholder resolutions when
possible. If this data is not available, we look at % votes in favor of
shareholder resolutions, as a majority of shareholder resolutions are
ESG related. We look at % votes at a fund level when possible. If this
data is not available, we look at % votes at the institutional level.

## Informal

By communicating with more companies about environmental and social
issues, investors may be able to convince more managers to implement
changes. Academic literature has demonstrated a 18-60% likelihood that a
shareholder engagement will be implemented by the target corporation,
providing strong evidence that shareholder engagement is an effective
mechanism through which investors can change company activities.\[16\]

The amount of resources devoted to an engagement, and the persistence of
the engagement, leads to a higher chance of success. Engagement as part
of investor coalitions also increases chance of success.\[17\]
Information on private engagement is more difficult to collect, and we
rely on self-reported data from a fund manager’s reports, including the
PRI Transparency Report. Companies can achieve higher scores in this
section if they are fully transparent about their engagement activities.

Engagement scores are calculated at the point of engagement. If an
institution engages with a company on behalf of all of its funds, then
all funds get engagement points. If engagement is conducted on behalf of
a subset of funds, only that subset receives credit.

Company commitments to change indicate real world impact that a fund
manager has, but this is not a perfect measure. Commitments secured are
self-reported by fund managers, and different fund managers may have
different standards for assessing a commitment to change. Commitments to
disclosure are worth half as much as commitments to changes in corporate
policies/practices. Additionally, commitments to change do not
necessarily signal major impact. Thus, metrics assessing investor effort
are more heavily weighted.

Leadership of collaborative engagements is crucial to their existence
and success. Success rates are elevated when there is a lead investor
who heads the dialogue.\[18\] Engaging with companies on novel issues
can raise those issues to the attention of the company from a legitimate
source. When done publicly in collaboration with other investors, these
novel engagements can contribute to the development of campaigns around
those issues, and bolster other actors in civil society focused on those
issues.\[19\] Shareholder resolutions on new issues can start a
conversation both inside and outside the company.\[20\]

# Public Sphere

## Public + Policy

Public policy is crucial to create ESG impact at scale. Investors have
participated in successful joint statements to publicly endorse certain
policies, and have directly lobbied policymakers and regulators.\[22\]
We do not award funds points for participation in non-ESG related public
policy. In addition to work on public policy, public statements to large
numbers of companies (such as public letters to portfolio company CEOs)
can signal public commitment, bring awareness to an ESG issue, and help
move companies take action. Some fund managers make public statements
that are anti-ESG, or aim to limit shareholders’ abilities to promote
ESG issues. These statements receive negative points

Fund managers send important signals to influence the general public.
They can also contribute to movements targeting the public reputation of
companies. Divestment is a common tactic to affect a company’s
reputation by creating public stigma.\[23\] Asset managers can allow
people to participate in a movement by offering a movement-aligned
product, such as a fossil fuel free investment product. Further action
to catalyze a movement helps the movement gain credibility and momentum.

## Growing The Field

Promoting ESG to other investors encourages the adoption of ESG
investing strategies, as well as encouraging increased shareholder
advocacy and public sphere work. Creating standards and benchmarks helps
other investors invest for ESG and have a framework for
engagement.\[24\]

Organizational memberships can indirectly develop the field of ESG and
have the same impact of increasing the ESG activity of the rest of the
investment field. Organizations that promote responsible investment
generate awareness and better execution of ESG investing. Organizations
that coordinate shareholder engagement also have impact by introducing
investors to engagement topics, facilitating dialogues between fund
managers and company management, lowering the costs of coordinated
action,\[25\] and increasing the salience of fund managers engaging as
part of a coalition.\[26\] Organizations that coordinate public policy
statements allow investors to amplify their voice on ESG-aligned public
policy issues.

| **Points (ALL)** | Number of memberships |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **0**            | No memberships        |
| **3**            | 1-9 memberships       |
| **6**            | 10+ memberships       |

Some organizations promote anti-ESG policies and practices, or aim to
limit shareholders’ abilities to promote ESG issues. Membership and
leadership in these organizations merits negative points

| **Points (All)** | Fund manager has memberships in organizations limiting shareowners’ ability to promote ESG issues         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **-12**          | At least one membership in an organization that is anti-ESG, or aims to limit shareholder rights          |
| **-24**          | At least one leadership position in an organization that is anti-ESG, or aims to limit shareholder rights |
| **0**            | If the fund manager has publicly stated its intention to improve its organizations’ anti-ESG policies     |

The more involved a member is in an organization, the more it helps to
drive the organization’s impact. Board memberships, governance committee
memberships, and leadership in committees/working groups/projects
receive extra points.

| **Points (ALL)** | Number of organizations with leadership position |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **6**            | 1 leadership position                            |

## Notes on Methodology

**Size**

While, all else equal, a larger investor will be more effective in
influencing companies and the public, it is not immediately clear that
an individual should choose to add dollars to a larger fund, because
adding dollars will also have a larger percentage contribution to a
smaller fund’s effectiveness. Because of the uncertainty, we do not
factor size into our methodology.

Another term for this is Social Return on Investment (SROI) - the dollar
value of public benefit. We assume constant returns to scale for SROI
based on fund size.

**Values**

This methodology is for environmental and social impact, not for rating
the politics of a fund manager. As such, it is important for this
methodology to maintain value neutrality beyond core environmental and
social principles. For example, fund managers would not receive credit
for supporting climate denial, but they would receive equal points for
advocating a cap-and-trade versus a carbon tax.

**Purview**

This methodology is for assigning ratings to individual funds. Some of
the criteria pertain to the asset manager's activities overall. But the
methodology supports different rankings for different funds under a
manager.

**Data**

This methodology was designed with an eye towards which data are
publicly available. Most of the requisite data are disclosed by members
of the UN PRI. Other data are publicly available but not necessarily in
a database, such as social movement alignment or research prolificacy.
